2. Clone the software project repository (from the Continuous Testing lab) into your local environment.
3. Sign up for a Heroku account if you don't have one.

# Usage Instructions
## Part 1: Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
1. Familiarize yourself with GitHub Actions.
2. Create a CI workflow for Node.js in your project.
