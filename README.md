# 1. Creation of a web application 

We created an application using the programming language NodeJS, and for the database where we stored the data we used Redis. <br>
Also, we have configured ther server and the application to be able to run on the port 3000.  <br>
After that, we covered the application with diferent test of diferent levels, in total in had 12 tests. <br>
All the test are functioning and we had respectivelly : 1 test for the Redis connection, 2 tests for the configuration, 5 for the user and finally 4 for the user RESET API <br>
