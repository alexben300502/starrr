# 1. Creation of a web application 

We created an application using the programming language NodeJS, and for the database where we stored the data we used Redis. <br>
Also, we have configured ther server and the application to be able to run on the port 3000.  <br>
After that, we covered the application with diferent test of diferent levels, in total in had 12 tests. <br>
All the test are functioning and we had respectivelly : 1 test for the Redis connection, 2 tests for the configuration, 5 for the user and finally 4 for the user RESET API <br>


# 2. Application of CI/CD pipeline 

----We configure github worflow for the userapi (project folder). After going to actions, we configure the YML file with redis configuration et node.js configuration. After that, we see that the automated tests are working.  

# 5  Make container orchestration using Docker Compose 

In this part of our project, we will be creating a  docker-compose.yml (mettre le lien) to start the <br>
application. This file will contain Redis and the web application root. <br>
We managed to run in with the command “docker-compose up” to be able to run it into the container we <br>
have just created. <br>
Indeed,The command "docker-compose up" is used to start and to run an entire Docker application. <br>

Now we are going to use the software postman which is a tool for testing  and interacting with application programming interfaces.  <br>
