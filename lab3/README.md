# lab3 : continuous testing 

# Short Description : The purpose of this lab is to focus on continuous testing in a development environment. It involves using a prepared User API application and implementing Test-Driven Development (TDD) to create a GET user functionality. We are able through this lab  to familiarize  with TDD principles, creating unit tests, and developing a REST API. 

# List of Functionalities :
# Running Prepared Tests: Utilizing existing tests in the User API application to understand the testing framework.
# Implementing GET User Functionality via TDD: Developing a new GET user feature using TDD, including writing unit tests and API tests, and also developing corresponding route methods.

# Installation Instructions
# Redis Database:
# Windows: Follow instructions 
# MacOS: Use brew install redis 
# Linux: Follow instructions
# DE/Text Editor:
# Install a text editor or IDE such as Atom or VS Code.
# NodeJS:
# Install NodeJS from nodejs.org. 

# Usage Instructions 
# Start Redis Server:
# Windows: Run redis-server.exe.
# MacOS/Linux: Execute redis-server in the terminal.
# Test Redis Server:
# Windows: Open redis-cli.exe and run ping.
# MacOS/Linux: In a new terminal window, run redis-cli ping.
# Setup User API Application:
# Navigate to the lab folder: cd lab.
# Install application dependencies: npm install.
# Run existing tests: npm test.
# Start the application: npm start.
# Implement GET User Functionality:
# Follow TDD approach: write unit tests in lab/test/user.controller.js and lab/test/user.router.js.
# Implement the controller method in lab/src/controllers/user.js.
